A program for controlling a dishwasher inspired by the Java textbook - it uses a stack of plates as an exmaple of a stack and I wanted to see if I could build a program that would allow a user to specify the amount of plates they wanted to add/remove from the stack.

To use the program enter a command word from the list given. 'help' will give you a breakdown of what each command word does.

This is also my first use of unit testing.
