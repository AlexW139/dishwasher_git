This is a program to run a simple dishwasher. It was basically inspired by the Java textbook when it describes a stack as being like a stack of plates where you can only remove things from the top - I wanted to see if you could make a verison of this where a user could specify how many items they wanted to add/remove from the stack etc. This also served as my first introduction to unit testing.
